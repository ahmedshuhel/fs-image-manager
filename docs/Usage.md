# Usage
The project was initiated to serve my purpose of browsing and uploading images to and from my media server, particularly photos; IOW, to browse/manage a private image storage. The media server in question also hosts Plex Media Server and that unfortunately does not allow downloading of images from web; which I needed to be able to share photos in Twitter, Facebook etc.

Only stable releases are installed on my media server. Currently SQLite 3 is used in the server; and stable releases are installed using [this script](https://gist.github.com/imyousuf/defec89073a0b0af4557a18225015115).

Latest releases are deployed by Travis CI once tag is pushed to the repo by the maintainer.
